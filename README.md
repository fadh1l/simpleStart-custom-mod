# simpleStart-custom-mod
- This is a startup page modded for my tastes originally forked from another post.
- It has a different wallpaper and custom coloring to suite it.
- Note: If you want to use it on your system, change the name Fadhil to your own in main.js.
- Similarly do the same for the number in the 2nd last line by copying the appropriate ID of your location from openweather.com
